 # Learning Scippy

This repository contains code that finds the minimum of a function. The code uses `scipy.optimize.minimize`. Find instructions to install scippy [here](https://scipy.org/install/). The code uses the [Nelder-Mead](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.minimize-neldermead.html#optimize-minimize-neldermead) method. 

One of the issues I ran into was for a certain region, the function does gives out the local minima instead of looking for the global minimum.

To run the code use:
```
python main.py

```
